# The cfSort function utilizes pre-trained deep neural network (DNN) models
# to estimate the tissue composition of testing samples. The implementation
# and training process of the DNN models can be found in the cfSort paper
# (https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2305236120).

# The two pre-trained DNN models in the extdata folder are deposited at
# Zenodo and can be downloaded from
# DNN1: https://zenodo.org/record/7884243/files/DNN1.h5?download=1
