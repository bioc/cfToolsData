# cfToolsData

The cfToolsData package supplies the data for the cfTools package (https://github.com/jasminezhoulab/cfTools). It contains two pre-trained deep neural network (DNN) models for the cfSort function. Additionally, it includes methylation patterns of markers associated with four tumor types for the CancerDetector function, as well as methylation patterns of markers specific to 29 primary human tissue types for the cfDeconvolve function.
