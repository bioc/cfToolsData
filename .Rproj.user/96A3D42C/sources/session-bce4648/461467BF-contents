Description: The cfToolsData package supplies the data for the cfTools package. 
    It contains two pre-trained deep neural network (DNN) models for the cfSort 
    function. Additionally, it includes methylation patterns of markers 
    associated with four tumor types for the CancerDetector function, as well as
    methylation patterns of markers specific to 29 primary human tissue types 
    for the cfDeconvolve function.
