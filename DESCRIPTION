Description: The cfToolsData package supplies the data for the cfTools package. 
    It contains two pre-trained deep neural network (DNN) models for the cfSort 
    function. Additionally, it includes the shape parameters of beta 
    distribution characterizing methylation markers associated with four tumor 
    types for the CancerDetector function, as well as the parameters 
    characterizing methylation markers specific to 29 primary human tissue 
    types for the cfDeconvolve function.
